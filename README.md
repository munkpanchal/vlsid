# VLSID

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation
1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the theme directory.
2. Run the following command to install all dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

#### Watch for Changes

During development, you can use the watch mode to automatically rebuild whenever changes are detected. Run the following command:

```bash
   npm run watch
```

This will start a watcher that monitors your source files, triggering a rebuild whenever a change is made.

### Production Build

#### Build for Production

When you're ready to deploy, use the following command to create a production-ready build:

```bash
   npm run build
```

This command optimizes and bundles your code, making it suitable for deployment. Find the output in the designated build directory.
